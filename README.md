# How to test the app

- Live demo: https://djordje.rs.ba/top10/

Or...

- Clone repository into local folder
- Open terminal and run: **npm install**
- To start the project, run: **npm start** (http://localhost:3000)

- For production run **npm run build**

  (Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
  It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.)
